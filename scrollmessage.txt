The Monkey is flying high in the sky.
Anyone who remembers watching the Wizard of Oz as a child will probably 
remember how horrifying the Wicked Witch of the Westâ€™s flying monkeys were. 
These monkeys were sent by the witch to do her dirty work, and the phrase has 
since become synonymous with people who end up doing the dirty work of a narcissist.
